## Homework Assignment #7 (200 points)

**The due date for this homework is Friday, April 4th by 5pm.**

PART A: The final MULTIQC output (.html) should be emailed to me. One file per group. Brightspace will not accept `.html` files. 
PART B: The Microsoft Word (.docx) file containing your interpretation should be submitted via Brightspace. 

Late homework will be docked 10% of the overall grade for every day that the assignment is late. An assignment is considered late if it is not submitted by the date and time specified. Three days past the due date (weekend included), the assignment will no longer be accepted, and the student(s) will receive a ZERO.
