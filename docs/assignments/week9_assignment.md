Most of these file types will not be accepted by Brightspace, therefore, please send me ONE email with PARTS A-D included. Late homework will be docked 10% of the overall grade for every day that the assignment is late. An assignment is considered late if it is not submitted by the date and time specified. Three days past the due date (weekend included), the assignment will no longer be accepted, and the student(s) will receive a ZERO.
