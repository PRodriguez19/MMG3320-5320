### Task 1: 
* On Terminal, open the manual page for the `rm` command. Skim through the information. What does the addition of the `-i` argument to `rm` do?   
    
* Quit the `man` buffer page and come back to your command prompt.  

> **Tip** - If the manual page within the Terminal is hard to read , the manual exists online too. For example, here is the linux manual page for `cp`. https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cp.1.html In addition to the arguments, you can also find good examples online; ***Google is your friend.***
