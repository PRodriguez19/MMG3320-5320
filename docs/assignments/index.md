### Green Trail Examples 

For the green trail, the goal is to recreate a figure or figure panel from a publication. In the Green Trail Example #1, this student was able to recreate Figure 1 from [Xian et al. 2022](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13402-022-00707-3)

### Blue Trail Examples 

For the blue trail, the goal is compare bioinformatic programs and contrast results. In the Blue Trail Example #1 & #2, the students successfully compared a genomic (STAR) vs transcriptomic (SALMON) aligner or fast-aligner (HISAT2). In Blue Trail Example #2, the students used [nf-core/rnaseq](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.14.0/) to compare multiple aligners at once.
