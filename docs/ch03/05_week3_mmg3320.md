## Shell scripts

Over the past few weeks, you have been introduced to a number of commands to explore data files. To demonstrate the function of each command we have run them one at a time at the command prompt. The command prompt is useful for testing out commands and also performing simple tasks like exploring and organizing the file system. However, when we are running analyses which require a series of tasks to be run, there is a more efficient way to do this. 

Shell scripts are **text files that contain commands we know we want to run**. In today's lesson, you will be introduced to both a simple and an advanced shell script example.

### What can shell scripts be used for? 

+ for creating, maintaining and implementing system-wide scripts
+ automating tedious repetitive tasks
+ scheduling and executing system tasks
+ for automating the installation process for new software or for new software updates across the organization
+ for scheduling data backup process

## A simple script

We are finally ready to see what makes the shell such a powerful programming environment. To create our first script, we are going to take some of the commands we have run previously and save them into a file so that we can **re-run all those operations** again later, by typing just **one single command**. For historical reasons, a bunch of commands saved in a file is referred to as shell script, but make no mistake, this is actually a small program! 

Interestingly, when working with Shell or on the command line you can give files any extension (.txt, .tsv, .csv, etc.). Similarly, for a shell script you don't need a specific extension. However, it is **best practice to give shell scripts the extension `.sh`** (bash shell script file).

Navigate into the `raw_fastq` directory and create a new file using Nano. 

Call the script `practice.sh`: 


***

**Class Exercise #2**

You will have ~5-10 minutes to complete.  
**NOTE: It is never my intention to rush you. If you do find you need more time to participate, please let me know.**

Create a script that is three lines: 
 
+ First line: You will write on your own. This line should: 
    + "Grab" all lines from Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq that contain 10 consecutive N's 
    + Be sure to use the appropriate arguments to output all (4) lines contained within a FASTQ read 
    + Then redirect the output to a file called redirect.txt 
+ Second line: You will copy and paste. 
    + You are adding some verbosity to your script by using the `echo` command. The `echo` command is used to display a line of text that is passed in as an argument. This is a bash command that is used to output status to the screen or file. Add the following line: 

    ```
    echo "The word count for redirect.txt is:" 
    ```
+ Third line: You will write on your own. This line should:
    +  Give a word count for redirect.txt 

> To run the shell script you can use the `sh` command, followed by the name of your script:

```bash
sh practice.sh
```

***

## Bash variables

A *variable* is a common concept shared by many programming languages. **Think of variables as a temporary store or "bucket" for a simple piece of information.** This bucket will have a name associated with it therefore when referring to the information inside the bucket, we can use the name of the bucket instead! 

First, to create a variable in bash, you will provide the name of the variable, followed by the equals sign and finish with the value we want to assign to the variable. 

```
name_of_variable=value_of_variable
```

+ Note that the variable name cannot contain spaces, nor can there be spaces on either side of the equals sign.

+ The variable name can have only letters (a to z or A to Z), numbers (0 to 9), or the underscore character (_). The wrong character usage in the variable name will cause a syntax error.

+ By convention, the variable names in UNIX are in UPPERCASE.


Let's start by creating a variable called `num` that has the number 25 stored inside it:

```bash
num=25
```
If we are using our bucket analogy - You can think of the variable `num` like this: 
<p align="center">
<img src="../img/images_created-1.png" width="600">
</p>

Once you press return, you will find yourself back at the command prompt. But nothing happened... so how do we know that we actually created a variable? 

One way to see the variable created is by using the `echo` command. As we learned earlier, this command takes the argument provided and prints it to the terminal. If we provide `num` as an argument it will be simply interpreted as a character string "num". We want `echo` to display the contents of the variable and not its name. To do this we need to **explicitly use a `$` in front of the variable name**:

```bash
echo $num
```

You should see the number 25 returned to you. Notice that when we created the variable, we did not use the `$`. 

### What is the `$`

The `$` is a standard shell notation for defining and using variables. The `$` tells the shell interpreter to treat the variable as a variable name and substitute its value in its place, rather than treat it as text or an external command.

**Therefore, when defining a variable (i.e. setting the value) you can just type it as is, but when retrieving the value of a variable you must use the `$`!** 

> **NOTE:** Variables are not physical entities like files. When you create files you can use `ls` to list contents and see if the file exists. To list all variables in your environment you can use the command `declare` with the `-p` option. You will notice that while you only have created one variable so far, the output of `declare -p` will be more than just one variable. These other variables are called environment variables. To remove a variable you can use `unset`. 


## Use variables as input to commands

So far, it is hard to see the utility of a variable and why we need it. One important aspect of the variable is that the value stored inside can be used as input to commands. 

Let's solidify this important concept. 

***

**Class Exercise #3**

1. Create a new variable called `file`. Use the name of one of the fastq files in the `raw_fastq` directory as the value of the variable.

2. Recall the variable with `echo` 

3. Check the number of lines in the `file` variable. 


> **NOTE:** The variables we create in a session are system-wide, and independent of where you are in the filesystem. This is why we can reference it from any directory. However, it is only available for your current session. If you exit the cluster and login again at a later time, the variables you have created will no longer exist.

***

## Assigning the output from a command to a variable

When creating shell scripts variables are used to store information that can be used later in the script (once or many times over). The value stored can be hard-coded in as we have done above, assigning the variable a numeric or character value. Alternatively, the value stored can be the output of another command. We will demonstrate this using a new command called `basename`.

The **`basename` command** is used for extracting the base name from a file path, which is accomplished using **string splitting**. 

> String splitting is a way to break a larger string into smaller parts based on a specified delimiter. The delimiter is a character or a sequence of characters that indicates where the string should be split. For example, if you have the string "apple,banana,orange" and use a comma as the delimiter, you can split it into three separate strings: "apple", "banana", and "orange". It's a handy technique often used in programming for data manipulation and analysis.

<p align="center">
<img src="../img/string_split.png" width="300">
</p>


> Other "common" strings include: 
    
	+ Space: Useful for splitting words in a sentence.
	+ Tab (\t): Often used in tab-delimited data files.
    + Semicolon (;): Another popular choice for separating values in data.
    + Colon (:): Commonly used in key-value pairs.
    + Pipe (|): Used in various data formats, such as CSV files.
    + Hyphen (-): Can be used to split ranges or parts of a string.
    + Underscore (_): Frequently used in variable or function names.

**Put more simply, a basename refers to the file or directory name without its path information.** It essentially provides the core name of the file or directory by removing the directory path and any leading prefixes or extensions. 

> For example, if you have the file path "/home/user/documents/report.txt," the basename would be "report.txt."



Let's try an example together by first moving back to your home directory:

```bash
cd
```

Then we will run the `basename` command on one of the FASTQ files. Be sure to specify the path to the file:

```bash
basename ~/unit1_unix/raw_fastq/Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq
```

**What is returned to you?**

The path was split into all text leading up to the last `/` (which is `~/unit1_unix/raw_fastq/`) and everything after the `/` which is the file name `Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq`. The command **returns only the file name**. 

Now, suppose we wanted to also **trim off the file extension** (i.e. remove `.fq` leaving only the file *base name*). We can do this by **adding a parameter** to the command to specify what string of characters we want trimmed.

```bash
basename ~/unit1_unix/raw_fastq/Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq .fq
```

You should now see that only `Mov10_oe_1.subset` is returned. 


***
**Class Exercise #4**

Use `basename` with the file `Irrel_kd_1.subset.fq` as input. Return only `Irrel_kd_1` to the terminal.

***

### Storing the `basename` output in a variable 

The `basename` command returns a character string and this too can be stored inside a variable. To do this without error, we need to add another special syntax because when we run the command we will generate spaces. If you remember earlier, one of the rules of creating variables is that there cannot be any spaces. 

> **NOTE:** The special syntax involves a key that is probably not used much on your keyboard, it is **the backtick key** <kbd>`</kbd>. On most keyboards this character is located just underneath the <kbd>esc</kbd> key. If you have trouble finding it you can also just copy and paste it from the materials.

The command that we are running is wrapped in backticks (one at the beginning and one at the end), and then we assign it to the variable as we would any other value. Let's try this with the `Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq` example from above:

```bash
samplename=`basename ~/unit1_unix/raw_fastq/Mov10_oe_1.subset.fq .fq`
```

Once you press return you should be back at the command prompt. Check to see what got stored in the `samplename` variable:

```bash
echo $samplename
```

> #### The `basename` command
> It is hard to see the utility of this command by just running it at command-line, but it is very useful command when creating scripts for analysis. Within a script it is common to create an output file and the `basename` allows us to easily create a prefix to use for naming the output files. This utility will be demonstrated in more detail next. 


## Shell scripting with bash variables using Jupyter Notebook 

Now it's time to put all of these concepts together to create a more advanced version of the script. This script will allow the user to get information on any given directory. These are the steps you will code into a shell script using Jupyter Notebook:

1. Assign the path of the directory to a variable
2. Create a variable that stores only the directory name (and no path information)
3. Move from the current location in the filesystem into the directory we selected in 1.
4. List the contents of the directory
5. List the total number of files in the directory

It seems like a lot, but you are equipped with all the necessary concepts and commands to do this quite easily!

### What is Jupyter Notebook 

Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. It's widely used in data science, scientific research, and education. The term "Jupyter" is derived from the combination of three core programming languages it supports: Julia, Python, and R.

**Class Exercise #5 and Homework Assignment**

This is a self-paced assignment. This is also the final assignment for today. If you would like to do this from home feel free! 

1. To get started move into the `other` directory. This system is user-friendly. You should be able to click from `unit1_unix` into `other` easily. 

2. Press New (Right-side) -> Text file -> and create a script called `directory_info.sh`. 

	In this script, we will be adding **comments by using the hashtag symbol `#`**. Lines in your script that begin with `#` will **not** be interpreted as code by Shell. Comments are crucial for proper documentation of your scripts. This will allow your future self to know what each line of code is doing!

	We will begin with a first comment describing the **usage of this script**. This lets anyone who is using the script know what it does and what they need to provide (if anything). In our case we need the user to provide a path to the directory of interest. 

3. Copy and paste the line below as line 1. 

	```bash
	## USAGE: Provide the full path to the directory you want information on
	```
4. Create a variable called `dirPath`. Assign this variable as the relative path to `raw_fastq` **Hint: You can find the path within this lesson!**. This will be line 2. 

5. Next copy and paste the line below to line 4. Yes, it is okay to skip a line to increase read-ability! 

	```
	# Get only the directory name
	```

6. Create another variable called `dirName`. Use this variable to store the directory name using the `basename` command and extract it from `dirPath`. *Make use of the `$` to retrieve the value stored inside the variable!* This will be line 5. 


	The next few tasks will require simple commands for changing directories and listing contents of the `raw_fastq` directory specified.

7. Copy and paste the line below to line 7. 

	```bash
	echo "Reporting on the directory" $dirName "..."
	```

8. Write a command to change directories into `dirPath`. *Make use of the `$` to retrieve the value stored inside the variable!*. This will be line 8. 

9. Copy and paste the lines below to lines 10-11. 

	```bash
	echo "These are the contents of" $dirName
	ls -l 
	```
	
	> Note: The command `ls -l` will give you the file contents of every file already specified in `dirPath`. There is no need to specify the location because it has already been provided in line 2 by you! 

	The final task of reporting the total number of files will require piping (`|`) together multiple commands:

10. Copy and paste the lines below starting at line 13. 

	```bash
	echo "The total number of files contained in" $dirName
	ls | wc -l

	echo "Report complete!"
	```

	After adding in a final `echo` statement, you are all set with script! Hit file Save.

11. Run the script `directory_info.sh`

## Summary   

In today's lesson, we described shell scripts and introduced a few related concepts that are helpful when you are starting out. It is important to understand each of the indvidual concepts, but also to see how they all come together to add flexibility and efficency to your script. Later on we will further illustrate the power of scripts and how they can make our lives (when coding) much easier. Any type of data you will want to analyze will inevitably involve not just one step, but many steps and perhaps many different tools/software programs. Compiling these into a shell script is the first step in creating your analysis workflow!
