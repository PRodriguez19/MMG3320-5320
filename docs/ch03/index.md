## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students will be able to:  

1. Use the `grep` command to search for specific characters or patterns in a text file.  
2. Redirect command output to a file using output redirection (`>` and `>>`) to write or append content.  
3. Apply the pipe (`|`) operator to create pipelines, connecting the output of one command as the input to another.  
4. Utilize the `wc` command to count lines, words, and characters in an input.  
5. Employ the `sort` command to organize input data in a specified order.  
6. Differentiate between `>` (overwrites content) and `>>` (appends content) for file redirection.  
7. Construct pipelines (`first | second`) to efficiently combine multiple commands in sequence.

## Ongoing List of Commands

```bash
cp [old] [new] copies a file

mkdir [directory-name] creates a new directory

ls lists all the files and directories in a specific location 

mv [old] [new] moves(renames) a file or directory 

rm removes(deletes) a file

`*` matches zero or more characters in a filename, so *.txt matches ALL files ending in .txt 

`?` matches a single character in a filename, so ?.txt matches a.txt or b.txt but not ab.txt 
```

```
+ Use of the <button>control</button> key may be described in many ways, including Ctrl-X, Control-X, or ^X. 

+ The shell does not have a trash bin, once something is deleted it is really gone. 

+ Most file names are `something.extension`. The extension is not required, but does help bioinformatic programs find required files (ex. FASTQC)

+ Depending on the type of work you do, you may need a more powerful text editor than Nano.
