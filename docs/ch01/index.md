## Unit 1

### Introduction 

In this unit, we will focus on developing foundational skills for using the command-line interface (CLI), with an emphasis on the `bash` shell. The `bash` shell is a powerful scripting environment commonly used for managing files, automating tasks, and interacting with software on Unix-based systems. By the end of this unit, you will learn how to execute basic commands, write simple scripts, and understand the principles behind shell scripting, enabling you to perform a range of computational tasks efficiently.

### Learning Objectives

1.	Navigate around the command line interface (bash/shell)
2.	Create and manipulate files and/or folders 
3.	Get comfortable with using the VACC, an high-performance computing cluster (HPC)
