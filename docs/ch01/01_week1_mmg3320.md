# Introduction to Command Line 

Command line interface (CLI) and graphical user interface (GUI) are
different ways of interacting with a computer's operating system. Most
people are familiar with the GUI as it is the default interface for most
software. When using a GUI, you see visual representations of files,
folders, applications, etc. However, when using the CLI, you will work
largely with text representation of files, folders, input, and output.

### What is a shell? 
The shell is a program where users can type commands. With the shell, it’s possible to invoke complicated programs like climate modeling software or simple commands that create an empty directory with only one line of code. The most popular Unix shell is Bash (the Bourne Again SHell — so-called because it’s derived from a shell written by Stephen Bourne). 
Using the shell will take some effort and some time to learn. While a GUI presents you with choices to select, CLI choices are not automatically presented to you, so you must learn a few commands like new vocabulary in a language you’re studying. 

### Benefits of using shell 
Working this way gives you access to internal  controls, remote servers, and the
ability to  customize workflows (scripts). So it gives you the ability
to create new files, edit the contents of those files, delete files, and
much more. 

In addition, the command line is often the easiest way to interact with remote machines and supercomputers. Familiarity with the shell is near essential to run a variety of specialized tools and resources including high-performance computing systems. As clusters and cloud computing systems become more popular for scientific data crunching, being able to interact with the shell is becoming a necessary skill. We can build on the command-line skills covered here to tackle a wide range of scientific questions and computational challenges.

### How to access the shell
On a Mac or Linux machine, you can access a shell through a program
called "Terminal" locally on your laptop. But to make things easier, we
will be using terminal on the open source web portal called Vermont
Advance Computing Center - Open OnDemand (VACC-OOD). Once on terminal,
you will be learning the basics of shell programming available under the
Bourne Again Shell (bash).

# Working with Remote Machines: Vermont Advance Computing Center Cluster (VACC)

### Why work on the VACC?  
Most data-processing tasks in bioinformatics require more computing power than we have on our workstations. For all bioinformatics projects performed in this course, you will work over a network connection with the VACC. 

**Cluster Basics**

<p align="center">

</p>

The image above reflects the many computers that make up a cluster. Each
individual computer in the cluster is a lot more powerful than any
laptop or desktop computer we are used to working with, and is referred
to as a **"node"** (instead of computer). Therefore, a "cluster" is a
large system consisting of 100s-1000s of nodes. Each node has a
designated role, either for logging in or for performing computational
analysis/work. A given cluster will usually have a few login nodes and
several compute nodes.

**Common characteristics of a Cluster:**

+ Large memory 
+ Storage shared across nodes 
+ High speed
interconnection network; suitable for high-throughput applications 
+ Shared by many users

***

**As of March 2022, the VACC provides three Clusters:**

+ BlackDiamond 
+ Bluemoon 
+ DeepGreen

We will primarily use the **Bluemoon** cluster for any downstream
analysis.

# VACC-OOD Overview 

Each student has been provided with their own personal VACC account that
they can use to access VACC-Open OnDemand (OOD).

### What is Open OnDemand (OOD)?  
Open OnDemand (OOD) is an open source web portal for high performance
computing (HPC) that provides users with an *easy-to-use* web interface
to HPC clusters.

**Benefits of using OOD:**

1. Web-based, no additional software needs to be installed on your local
machine

2. The easiest way to run graphical user interface (GUI) applications
remotely on a cluster

3. Typical computing with command-line requires a *high learning curve*
whereas OOD is easy to use and simple to learn

**GUI applications offered by VACC-OOD:**

+ Equipped with **Terminal**: this is used to perform tasks on the
command line (shell), both locally and on remote machines.

<p align="center">

<img src ="../img/RStudio-Logo.png" width="300"> 
</p>

### How to log-in to VACC-OOD (You should always do this!):  

1. Use the [VACC-OOD](https://vacc-ondemand.uvm.edu) link to access the
site https://vacc-ondemand.uvm.edu

2. Add your uvm netid and password

3. You should be viewing the following dashboard

<p align="center"> 
<img src ="../img/dashboard.png" width="700"> 
</p>

4. To access the Terminal Go to <button>Clusters</button>  and click
`>_VACC Shell Access`

</p>

### Connecting to VACC with SSH 
 
If you already had a VACC account and/or are currently working towards
generating and analyzing your own data, you may want to learn to log-in
without VACC-OOD.

To do so, first open your terminal locally on your computer.

<p align="center"> 
<img src="../img/terminal1.png" width="300"> 
</p>

Once you open your terminal, your screen should look similar to below: 

<p align="center"> 
<img src="../img/login7.png" width="700"> 
</p>

You see the "$" symbol?

That is where you write the "commands" that will be executed by shell
(bash in this case) and your computer's kernel.

The "$" is called the **"command prompt"**.

### What is SSH? 
There are many ways to connect to another machine over a network, but by far the most common is through the secure shell (SSH). We use SSH because its encrypted. This makes it secure to send passwords and edit private data files. 

### Step-by-step instructions to connect to the login node on VACC:

1. Type in the `ssh` command at the command prompt followed by a space, and then type your username (e.g. uvm net id) plus the address of the cluster `@vacc-user1.uvm.edu`.

  ```bash 
  ssh username@vacc-user1.uvm.edu 
  ```

2. Press the return/enter key and you should receive a prompt for your password. Type in your password and note that **the cursor will not move as you type** it in! This is normal and know that the computer is receiving and  transmitting your typed password to the remote system, i.e. the VACC cluster.

  <p align="center"> 
  <img src="../img/login2.png" width="700"> 
  </p>


3. If this is the first time you are connecting to the cluster, **a warning will pop up** and will ask you if you are sure you want to do this; **type `Yes` or `Y`**.

> **Tip** - Syntax for all commands on the command-line interface is the
> command followed by space and then     optionally a few arguments.
> 

Once logged in, you should see a new command prompt:

### Using VACC-OOD OFF-campus

To use OFF-campus you will need to VPN first. See (install-cisco-vpn)[https://www.uvm.edu/it/kb/article/install-cisco-vpn/] for more information!

## Copying example data folder  

Now that we are logged-in to the VACC, lets explore terminal. Your
screen should look similar to the following:

<p align="center"> 
<img src="../img/login5.png" width="700"> 
</p>

The "$" is called the **"command prompt"**.

The command prompt on VACC will have some characters before the `$`,
something like `[username@vacc-user1 ~]`, this is telling you your
username and the name of the login node you have connected to.

***The dollar sign is a prompt which shows us that the shell is waiting
for input. Moving forward, when typing commands, either from these
lessons or from other sources, do not type in the command prompt $, only
the command that follows it.***

The first thing to do is to check if there are any files in the data
folder we are currently in. When you log in to a cluster, you will land
within a folder designated specifically for your use, and is referred to
as your "home directory". We will begin by listing the contents of our home directory using a command called `ls`.

```bash 
ls 
```

> **Tip** - `ls` stands for "**l**i**s**t" and it lists the contents of
> a directory. 
> 

First let's remove this directory from last semester: 

```bash
rm -r unix_lesson
```

Now let's bring in a data folder from a different location on the
cluster to our home directory by using the `cp` command. **Copy and
paste the following command** all the way from `cp` and including the
period symbol at the end `.`

```bash 
cp -r /gpfs1/cl/mmg3320/course_materials/tutorials/unit1_unix .
```

> Let's break this down.  
'cp' is the command for copy. This command required you to specify the
location of the item you want to copy
(/gpfs1/cl/mmg3320/course_materials/tutorials/unit1_unix) and the
location of the destination (.); please note the space between the two
in the command. The “-r” is an option that modifies the copy command to
do something slightly different than usual. The "." means "here", i.e.
the destination location is where you currently are.

Now, you should see "unit1_unix" show up as the output of `ls`. This is
a folder we should all have in our home directory.

``` 
ls 
```

## Listing contents of data folder 

Let's look at what is inside the folder "unit1_unix" and explore this
further. We are use to clicking on a folder name to open it, however,
now we are forced to change our mindset and open a folder or "directory"
differently within the shell environment.

To look inside the `unit1_unix` directory, we need to change which
directory we are *in*. To do this we can use the `cd` command, which
stands for "change directory".

```bash 
cd unit1_unix
```

Notice the change in your command prompt. The "~" symbol from before
should have been replaced by the string `unit1_unix`. This means that
our `cd` command ran successfully and we are now *in* the new directory.
Let's see what is in here by listing the contents:

```bash 
ls 
```

You should see:

``` 
genomics_data  other  raw_fastq  README.txt  reference_data 
```

Notice that `ls` has printed the name of the files and directories in
the current directory in alphabetical order, arranged neatly into
columns.

### Arguments

There are five items listed when you run `ls`, but how do you know if
these are files or directories with more items inside?

To answer this question, we can modify the default behavior of `ls` by
adding an **"argument"** to get more information.

```bash 
ls -F 
```

``` 
genomics_data/  other/  raw_fastq/  README.txt  reference_data/ 
```

Anything with a "/" after its name is a directory. Things with an
asterisk "*" after them are programs.  If there are no "decorations"
after the name, it's a normal text file.

Each line of output represents a file or a directory. The directory
lines start with `d`.

### How to get more information on Arguments

Most commands will take additional arguments that control their
behavior. How do we know what arguments are available for a particular
command? The most commonly used shell commands have a manual available
that can be accessed using the `man` command. Let's try this command
with `ls`:

```bash 
man ls 
```

This will open the manual page for `ls` and you will lose the command
prompt. It will bring you to a so-called "buffer" page, a page you can
navigate with your mouse or if you want to use your keyboard we have
listed some basic key strokes:

* 'spacebar' to go forward * 'b' to go backward * Up or down arrows to
go forward or backward, respectively

**To get out of the `man` "buffer" page and to be able to type commands
again on the command prompt, press the `q` key!**

***

## Class Exercise  

* Use the `-l` option for the `ls` command to display more information
for each item in the `unit1_unix` folder. What additional information
is provided that you didn't see with the bare `ls` command?
