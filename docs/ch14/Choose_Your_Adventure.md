## Choose Your Own Adventure

You’ve built a strong foundation in R—now it’s time to put those skills to work! In these quick challenges, you can choose to do 1, 2, or all of them! 

1. **Multipanel Figure Creation** – Use `ggplot2`, `patchwork`, or `cowplot` to craft a polished, PDF "publication-ready" figure that tells a clear visual story.

Tutorial can be found [here](multi_panel_figure_update.html)

```bash

```

2. **Microbiome Analysis with ampvis2** – Dive into microbiome data using `ampvis2`, a powerful R package designed for simplified analysis and visualization. Easily generate ordination plots, heatmaps, and alpha/diversity metrics.

```

3. **Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)** – Continue using `clusterProfiler` to interpret gene expression results and uncover enriched biological pathways. Rather than just focusing on individual genes, GSEA analyzes gene sets as a whole, making it particularly useful for understanding complex biological processes and disease mechanisms.
