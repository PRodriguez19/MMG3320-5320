The workshop will introduce participants to the basics of R and RStudio. R is a simple programming environment that enables the effective handling of data, while providing excellent graphical support. RStudio is a tool that provides a user-friendly environment for working with R. These materials are intended to provide both basic R programming knowledge and its application for increasing efficiency for data analysis.</p>"},{"location":"#learning-objectives","title":"Learning Objectives","text":"<ul> <li>Be able to describe the diference between R and RStudio</li> <li>Be able to use common R syntax </li> <li>Describe frequently-used data types and data structures in R</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#citation","title":"Citation","text":"<p>This lesson has been developed by members of the teaching team at the Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core (HBC).
