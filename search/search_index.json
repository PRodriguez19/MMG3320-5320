The advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms has made sequencing more accessible, faster, and less expensive, resulting in over 150,000 publicly available datasets that can be utilized to support research findings or testing hypotheses. In this course, students will learn and execute key steps in the bioinformatic workflow by processing a publicly available genomics dataset. By the end of the course, students will have accessed, processed, analyzed, visualized, and interpreted an NGS dataset of their choosing. The course covers several topics, including an introduction to UNIX, data processing, R programming basics (including data frames, cleaning, and fundamentals with ggplot2), as well as an in-depth overview of selected genomics analysis. Throughout the course, best practices for reproducible data and data management will be emphasized. The course uses a direct, hands-on approach, as such most classes are interactive and require student participation.</p>"},{"location":"#required-platforms-and-software","title":"Required platforms and software:","text":"<p>Each student will be provided with an account on the Vermont Advanced Computing Cluster (VACC).

Base-calling algorithms process the raw signal to decode the sequence of bases within strands of DNA or RNA into data stored in BAM or FASTQ files. </p> Summary of technical validity and clinical utility assessment for cancer NGS. (A) NGS basecalling, wherein a DNA sequence and corresponding confidence score is generated from a nuclear genomic DNA template. (B) The next step, which compares all available data to the reference and each other. Variant calling is then performed (underlined bases in panel B), comparing base calls across many reads; many false positive variant calls (x'ed out bases) can be filtered, while true positives (circled bases) should generate a strong signal.

Next, we specify what flag we would like to run. For example, you can specify threads to indicate the number of processors on your computer that you want Trimmomatic to use. In most cases using multiple threads (processors) can help to run the trimming faster. These flags are not necessary, but they can give you more control over the command. The flags are followed by positional arguments, meaning the order in which you specify them is important. In paired end mode, Trimmomatic expects the two input files, and then the names of the output files. These files are described below. While, in single end mode, Trimmomatic will expect 1 file as input, after which you can enter the optional settings and lastly the name of the output file.</p> option meaning inputFile1 Input reads to be trimmed. Typically the file name will contain an _1 or _R1 in the name. inputFile2 Input reads to be trimmed. Typically the file name will contain an _2 or _R2 in the name. outputFile1P Output file that contains surviving pairs from the _1 file. outputFile1U Output file that contains orphaned reads from the _1 file. outputFile2P Output file that contains surviving pairs from the _2 file. outputFile2U Output file that contains orphaned reads from the _2 file. <p>In addition, trimmomatic expects to see is the trimming parameters:</p> step meaning ILLUMINACLIP Perform adapter removal. SLIDINGWINDOW Perform sliding window trimming, cutting once the average quality within the window falls below a threshold. LEADING Cut bases off the start of a read, if below a threshold quality. TRAILING Cut bases off the end of a read, if below a threshold quality. CROP Cut the read to a specified length. HEADCROP Cut the specified number of bases from the start of the read. MINLEN Drop an entire read if it is below a specified length. TOPHRED33 Convert quality scores to Phred-33. TOPHRED64 Convert quality scores to Phred-64. <p>We will use only a few of these options and trimming steps in our analysis. It is important to understand the steps you are using to clean your data.

Many tools can take BAM files as input and output the number of reads (counts) associated with each feature of interest (genes, exons, transcripts, etc.). Two commonly used counting tools are featureCounts and htseq-count.</p> <ul> <li> <p>These tools report raw counts, meaning they only count reads that map uniquely to a single location in the genome. They are most effective for counting at the gene level. In this approach, the total read count for a gene (meta-feature) is the sum of reads assigned to each of its exons (features).</p> </li> <li> <p>Some other tools account for multiple transcripts per gene, assigning fractional counts instead of whole numbers. For example, if one read aligns to two transcripts, it may be counted as 0.5 for each transcript rather than a whole number.</p> </li> <li> <p>There are also tools that count multimapping reads, but this approach can lead to overcounting, which affects normalization and ultimately compromises the accuracy of differential gene expression analysis.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Input for counting = multiple BAM files + 1 GTF file</p> <p>Simply speaking, the genomic coordinates of where the read is mapped (BAM) are cross-referenced with the genomic coordinates of whichever feature you are interested in counting expression of (GTF), it can be exons, genes or transcripts.</p> <p>Output of counting = A count matrix, with genes as rows and samples are columns</p> <p>These are the \"raw\" counts and will be used in statistical programs downstream for differential gene expression.
